#+title: Exactly what it says on the tin

We're really trying out here.

* Prerequisites
+ =cmake 3.19^=
+ =ninja= (but not really, just bc I hate slow builds)
+ =pkg-config= possibly, still can't tell

* Building
#+begin_src sh
cmake -S . -B build -G ninja
cmake --build build
#+end_src

Executable is =build/tess-demo=. No install.

* Roadmap
+ [X] Make a demo that actually compiles and invokes Tesseract
+ [ ] Figure out =tessdata= to actually OCR an image
+ [ ] Eventually rewrite this whole thing in Common Lisp

* Why was this so hard
+ Tesseract's user manual says "we assume you are familiar with compiling and linking" which I am, but not with CMake.
+ CMake's documentation does not have a good best practices introduction.
+ Even the best modern CMake tutorials out there don't really have a way of telling you that individual libraries are quirky and complicated.
+ Because, historically, the system's package manager /was/ the C++ package manager.
